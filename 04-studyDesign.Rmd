# Sampling design

```{r}
#general packages used
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

We should all know what these are and how to render a report in RMarkdown. Next we will produce a RMarkdown document for the question we have been working on ready to add data and other sampling design information. 

1. Outcome and predictor variables
2. Other study examples and code
3. Other studies with same sampling design
4. Other reference material.
5. Read a cool sampling design/issue paper
