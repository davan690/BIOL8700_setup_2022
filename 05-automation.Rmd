# Automation

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 

You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

## RMarkdown reports

We should all know what these are and how to render a report in RMarkdown. Next we will produce a RMarkdown document for the question we have been working on ready to add data and other sampling design information. 

1. Outcome and predictor variables
2. Other study examples and code
3. Other studies with same sampling design
4. Other reference material.
5. Read a cool sampling design/issue paper

Watch this short (ish video) as a summary of what you should understand so far.

What does this tell us about how RProjects and other funky things work?

3. Data import

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/Analysis_ardMods.csv")
```


4. Data visualisation

```{r}
# table(dat$Well.Position)
mean(dat$Delta.Ct.Mean, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(dat$Delta.Ct.Mean, na.rm = TRUE)

hist(dat$Delta.Ct.Mean)
```


5. Tidyverse approach

```{r}
glimpse(dat)
```

6. Nicer plots using `ggplot`
