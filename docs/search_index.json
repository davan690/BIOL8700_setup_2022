This combination of programming languages is included in the RMarkdown package. We use this and a variation of other RMarkdown packages to make the most of reproducible reporting in R. 3.2 Data importing There are scripts and code included within this repository to import data from csv and excel files from local and online locations. 3.3 Results You can also embed plots, code and data in an RMarkdown document. The core results of this repository are as follows: In that case, dont forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. 3.3.1 Quick overview of last week Run the R chunk below and check that you have all the packages running from last week. library(rmarkdown) library(rticles) library(bookdown) library(bookdownplus) library(tidyverse) #&gt; -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 -- #&gt; v ggplot2 3.3.5 v purrr 0.3.4 #&gt; v tibble 3.1.6 v dplyr 1.0.8 #&gt; v tidyr 1.2.0 v stringr 1.4.0 #&gt; v readr 2.1.2 v forcats 0.5.1 #&gt; -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- #&gt; x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() #&gt; x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(readxl) Can you import the data set you found last week in class? #read.csv #read.xl #example from What options did we have?

We are often focused on the cookbook aspect of experiments  the protocols and steps required to conduct each experiment. However, its critical to spend time designing your overall experimental approach and the finer details to ensure that your research will produce robust data that can be clearly analysed without bias. When we test specific questions, we want to avoid statistical issues such as noise and confounding factors. Terry Neeman will be delivering a workshop to help you strengthen your experimental plan  both in terms of your proposed design, and to help you more clearly and accurately explain the rationale and set-up of your experiments. This workshop will help you apply the principles taught in BIOL8291 to your own experiment. To prepare, you will create an outline of your experimental plan, focusing on the statistical framework of your design. Below is an outline of questions for you to answer/justify for each part of your experimental plan. You will also need to draw two figures (digital drawings preferred) for each aim that show: a simple overview of the experimental plan related to the research aim, a detailed snap-shot of the experimental set up (i.e., how will the plates, plants, etc. be arranged? Will there be a row-column design? Blocking? Randomization? What treatments will be applied and how many replicates will be tested?) You can access the template for the experimental plan on Wattle or a copy can be found within this repository. DOWNLOAD NOW. The template is laid out below as follows: 4.1 Research Question(s)? #input question here 4.2 Experimental Aims? For each experiment explain the overall experimental approach (1-3 sentences + overview diagram) list: the response variables/outcome measure(s) for the experiment the experimental factor(s) of interest the experimental conditions (groups for comparisons), and the number of replicates/sample size for each condition the experimental control(s) are their any potentially confounding factors (nuisance factors)? Briefly explain how they will be tracked/or mitigated Briefly explain the design of the experiment and provide a diagram that shows a snap shot of the experimental set-up (e.g., how all the plants under different experimental conditions will be arranged, all the plates in the lab, a flow chart of computational steps, etc.). Make sure to consider and include relevant design aspects like blocking, randomisation, as well as to clearly indicate treatments, replicate numbers, and controls.

The references for a bookdown or rmarkdown file can be included using the following information in the yml header of the index file. The references for a bookdown or rmarkdown file can be included using the following information in the yml header of the index file. 7.2 Manual references 7.3 Packages The goal of BIOL877_setup_2022 repository here is to provide a starting point for using RMarkdown and RStudio to undertake research. 7.4 Download project and files We checked and loaded an RMarkdown This is a sample book written in Markdown and extended from the original RMD file. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 7.5 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 7.6 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 7.7 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() 7.8 Output files One of the benefits of working in RMarkdown is that the gitbook extension is that it can easily be hosted on github. To do this with the least hurdles is to publish the output files as a github pages site from the .docs/. "]]
