You can include R chunks like so: Youll still need to render README.Rmd regularly, to keep README.md up-to-date. devtools::build_readme() is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render README.Rmd every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples. 1.1 Results You can also embed plots, code and data in an RMarkdown document. The core results of this repository are as follows: In that case, dont forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. 1.2 RStudio project file https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html # About This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.3 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.4 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.5 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() This week we are going to set up our projects ready for Terry Newmans sample/survey design session next week. This will involve: 1.6 RMarkdown reports We shouls all know what these are and how to render a report in RMarkdown. This week we will produce a Rmarkdown report for your question ready to add data and other sampling design using a simple word, html or pdf template. library(rmarkdown) library(rticles) library(bookdown) library(bookdownplus) What does this tell us about how RProjects and other funky things work?
