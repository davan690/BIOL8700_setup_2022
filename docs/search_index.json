You can include R chunks like so: Youll still need to render README.Rmd regularly, to keep README.md up-to-date. devtools::build_readme() is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render README.Rmd every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples. 1.1 Tools This is a sample book written in Markdown and includes embedded R code. This combination of programming languages is included in the RMarkdown package. We use this and a variation of other RMarkdown packages to make the most of reproducible reporting in R. 1.2 Data importing There are scripts and code included within this repository to import data from csv and excel files from local and online locations. 1.3 Results You can also embed plots, code and data in an RMarkdown document. The core results of this repository are as follows: In that case, dont forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. 1.4 RStudio project file https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html 1.5 Research Question(s)? 1.6 Experimental Aims? 1.7 Importing data 1.8 Visualising data 1.9 Reporting 1.10 RMarkdown reports "]]
