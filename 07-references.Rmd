`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '
# References {-}
'`

One aspect that can be challenging when working with RMarkdown documents for manuscripts is references.

```{r include=FALSE}
#list all packages loaded for this project

## add them to literature database



# create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

The references for a bookdown or rmarkdown file can be included using the following information in the `yml` header of the index file.

## Manual references





## Packages

```{r}

```
