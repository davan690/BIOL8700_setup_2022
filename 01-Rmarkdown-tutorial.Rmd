title: "Applications of R for research"
---


This week we are going to set up our projects ready for Terry Newmans sample/survey design session next week.

This will involve:

## RMarkdown reports

We shouls all know what these are and how to render a report in RMarkdown. This week we will produce a Rmarkdown report for your question ready to add data and other sampling design using a simple word, html or pdf template.

```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
library(rticles)
library(bookdown)
library(bookdownplus)
```

What does this tell us about how RProjects and other funky things work?

3. Data import

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```



4. Data visualisation



5. Tidyverse approach



6.    ggplot

Tasks ready for next week:

1. Outcome and predictor variables



3. Other studies with same sampling design

5. Other reference material.

7. Read a cool sampling design/issue paper

Watch this short (ish video) as a summary of what you should understand so far.
