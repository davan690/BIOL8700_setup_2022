title: "RMarkdown tips and tricks"
---

Last week we began to set up our projects using RMarkdown and R code so that we are ready for Terry Newmans sample/survey design session. Now this is postponed till next week we can finish this off. This week will continue as follows:

1. Run the R chunk below and check that you have all the packages running from last week

```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
library(rticles)
library(bookdown)
library(bookdownplus)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

2. Can you import the dataset you found last week in class?

```{r}
#read.csv
#read.xl
```

- What options did we have?
- Here I will take the following dataset and extend this to include some code and plots for the data

3. Follow along with the next chapter....
