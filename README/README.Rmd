# BIOL8700_setup_2022

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BIOL8700_setup_2022 is to setup and generate documents using RStudio, RMarkdown and github

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

## Tools

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown** and includes embedded R code. This combination of programming languages is included in the RMarkdown package. We use this and a variation of other RMarkdown packages to make the most of reproducible reporting in R.

## Data importing

There are scripts and code included within this repository to import data from csv and excel files from local and online locations.

## Results

You can also embed plots, code and data in an RMarkdown document. The core results of this repository are as follows:

```{r}

```
