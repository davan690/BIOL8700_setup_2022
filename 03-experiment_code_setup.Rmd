# RMarkdown reports

We should all know what these are and how to render a report in RMarkdown. This week we will produce a Rmarkdown report for your question ready to add data and other sampling design using a simple word, html or pdf template.

```{r}

```

What does this tell us about how RProjects and other funky things work?

3. Data import

```{r}

```


4. Data visualisation



5. Tidyverse approach



6.    ggplot

Tasks ready for next week:

1. Outcome and predictor variables



3. Other studies with same sampling design

5. Other reference material.

7. Read a cool sampling design/issue paper

Watch this short (ish video) as a summary of what you should understand so far.

## Automation

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 

You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
